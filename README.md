**COVID-Details Project README**

Overview
The COVID-Details project is a Spring Boot application designed to provide a comprehensive overview of COVID-19 data. This project utilizes various dependencies, including Spring Boot Starter Data JPA, Spring Boot Starter Web, and H2 database, to manage and display COVID-19 related information.

**Project Structure**
The project is structured as follows:

src/main/java: Contains the Java source code for the application.
src/main/resources: Holds the application's configuration files, including the application.properties file.
src/test/java: Contains the test cases for the application.
pom.xml: The Maven project file that manages dependencies and build settings.

**Dependencies
The project uses the following dependencies:**

spring-boot-starter-data-jpa: Provides support for JPA (Java Persistence API) and database operations.
spring-boot-starter-web: Enables the application to handle HTTP requests and responses.
h2: An in-memory database used for storing and retrieving COVID-19 data.
lombok: A library that simplifies Java development by automatically generating boilerplate code.
spring-boot-starter-test: Provides support for unit testing and integration testing.

**Test Cases**

The project includes a set of test cases to ensure the application's functionality and correctness. These test cases cover the following scenarios:

Unit tests: Test individual components and services to ensure they function as expected.
Integration tests: Test the interaction between components and services to ensure the application works as a whole.

**Running the Application**
To run the application, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory.
Run the command mvn spring-boot:run to start the application.
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080 to access the application.

**Running Test Cases**
To run the test cases, follow these steps:

Navigate to the project directory.
Run the command mvn test to execute the test cases.

Notes:
The application uses an in-memory database, so data will be lost when the application is restarted.
The application is designed to provide a basic overview of COVID-19 data and may not include all features or data points.
Future Development
The COVID-Details project is a starting point for further development and expansion. Future development may include:

Adding more data points and features to the application.
Integrating with external data sources to provide more comprehensive information.
Improving the user interface and user experience.
